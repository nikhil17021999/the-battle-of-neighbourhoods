# the-battle-of-neighbourhoods

1) Introduction/Business Problem
   The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood.
2) Downloading and Prepping Data
   To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood  and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.

Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a

Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f


3)    Results
Results section where you discuss the results.

Comparing the maps we can notice the majority of the restaurants grouped on main streets and on the south of the city, although some of the welthiest neighborhoods are up to the north. Also, the areas with a dense population don't reflect on the number of restaurants.



4) Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

This report may be helpful for someone planning on opening a restaurant in Toronto, by comparing the current offers and neighborhoods profiles, however it may not cover all variables such as access to public transportation or even the restaurants profiles, so it shall not be used as a single decidion making tool.
